# Readme

This is a list of the firmwares / configs we've used for the CNC

This is the first one we used which is GRBL on a Arduino
This is no longer in use

This is grbl running on a ESP32.
This was originally setup by Mark, but it's now been replaced by FluidNC

## FluidNC

FluidNC is the same as grbl on the ESP32 but a newer / rebranded version
It's configuration is different from that of the original ESP32 Grbl
