One of the main problems with milling PCB's is that the copper board tends not to be completely flat.
So you end up ether milling too much and making a mess of the board, or not enough missing some parts of the board.

One way around this is to use an inductive proximity sensor to take measurements of the copper board relative to the milling head.
Typically, this is wired into Z-Min I think on the board. This can then be used as an offset to the milling profile to compensate for an uneven Copper board.

It should be mentioned that other software such as FlatCAM also have these features inbuilt as well as double sided board support, although I have yet to try this out (since we don't have a sensor wired in just yet)
