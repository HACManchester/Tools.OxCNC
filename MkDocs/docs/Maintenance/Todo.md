# Todo

## Milling bits

  * Ideally we could do with some 6mm milling bits for clearing large areas <br>
    <https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00XTWOT9O>
  * look into how many 3mm milling bits we have as they are considered a consumable.

## Mounting Holes

  * Add some screw in mounting holes to the spoiler table

## Stepper Drivers

  * At the moment the stepper drivers are around 1A, but the motors are around 2.8A <br>
    So we're probably only getting limited torque / power from the motors. <br>
    A future idea would be to upgrade the electronics with some TMC stepper drivers.

## Rpi

  * We need to upgrade the Rpi1 to a Rpi3 <br>
    The serial buffer is maxing out the CPU, and it would be useful to have a remote desktop session available.

## 4th Axis

  * One interesting thing we could do is 3d print a 4th axis for the cnc.

## Dust Brush

We need to 3d Print a head to go over the top of the milling bit and allow the attachment of

  * A ring of LED's
  * The hose for the vacume extractor.

## Touch Plate

Look into setting up a touch plate for mill bits, and a downward inductive sensor for PCB milling
