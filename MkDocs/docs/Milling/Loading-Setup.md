# Loading the G-Code

## Loading from a local file on Disk

In order to load a local G-Code file on disk,<br>
you just drag and drop the file on top of the browser window with Chillipepr In


## Recent Files

Chillipepr seems to cache the most recent files that have been dragged / dropped onto it. <br>
If you need to clear the cache for any reason the controls at the upper left can be used. <br>
These can also reset the G-Code to the default Chillipepr logo.

## Widgets

There are a number of widgets available that can be handy to use

  * **Auto-Level** - This can be used with an inductive sensor to map out the imperfections in a copper board before milling.
  * **JSCut** - This can be used to directly import G-Code from JSCut
  * **Eagle BRD Import** - This can be used for importing a Eagle board file in and converting it to G-Code. <br>
    For Gerber files from other ECad software such as KiCad I'd suggest looking at FlatCAM first then using the Auto-level feature in combination.
  * **TouchPlate** - Can be used (once we have a sensor setup) to position the end of the mill bit on the Z Axis correctly.
