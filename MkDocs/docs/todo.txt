When using JScut

make sure to position the head about 3mm down on the z axis first then zero the machine
the G-Code will raise the head by 2.5mm between movements from area to area so this is important
otherwise the Z axis will try to go too high and trip the alarm / end stop

Chenfu pointed me to towards this one as a potential option for the CNC Software
It seems to work okay if you get the settings right
It seems to lack a retraction option for when moving between section to section


Test

Check if there are buffer issues when connecting direcly to the arduino board, also double check the grbl setting in chillipepr


Safety

It may be best to reset the grbl board on power down / estop
that way a home will be forced before the machine can start recieving G-Code again



Firmware

double check we're using a 328p processor (Uno, Duemilanove, Nano, Micro, etc) for the arduino
also backup the existing firmware hex

we also need to use this link for grbl 1.1
