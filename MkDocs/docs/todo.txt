When using JScut

make sure to position the head about 3mm down on the z axis first then zero the machine
the G-Code will raise the head by 2.5mm between movements from area to area so this is important
otherwise the Z axis will try to go too high and trip the alarm / end stop

Chenfu pointed me to towards this one as a potential option for the CNC Software
It seems to work okay if you get the settings right
It seems to lack a retraction option for when moving between section to section
