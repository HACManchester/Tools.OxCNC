When using JScut

make sure to position the head about 3mm down on the z axis first then zero the machine
the G-Code will raise the head by 2.5mm between movements from area to area so this is important
otherwise the Z axis will try to go too high and trip the alarm / end stop

Chenfu pointed me to towards this one as a potential option for the CNC Software
It seems to work okay if you get the settings right
It seems to lack a retraction option for when moving between section to section


Test

Check if there are buffer issues when connecting direcly to the arduino board, also double check the grbl setting in chillipepr


Safety

It may be best to reset the grbl board on power down / estop
that way a home will be forced before the machine can start recieving G-Code again



Firmware

double check we're using a 328p processor (Uno, Duemilanove, Nano, Micro, etc) for the arduino
also backup the existing firmware hex

we also need to use this link for grbl 1.1

## Electronics

From the looks of things, it looks like an Arduino Uno is in use with a CNC Shield
I think one of these: https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-cnc-shield/

Based on the ooznest site, the stepper motors are probably 2.8A Nema 23's.

The stepper drivers I think are Pololu - Allegro A4988
without cooling (currently the case) the max Amps you can get is around 1A
with cooling the max amps is around 2A

This means at present we're probably only getting around 50% of the potential power of the stepper drivers
not a big issue for cutting wood, but it's worth considering for the future if we want to mill harder materials.

make sure to select grbl in the drop down



rpi appears to be maxing out on the cpu when doing a lot of g-code
updating grbl seems to have improved this, but we need to replace the pi1 with a pi3

the plan is to optionally allow remote desktop onto the pi3, and or have a centeral machine people can log onto for controlling the cnc / 3d printer etc
